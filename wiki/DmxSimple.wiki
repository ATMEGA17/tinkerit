This library gives you a simple way to drive DMX from Arduino. DMX output is on digital pin 3, which is compatible with the Tinker.it! DMX shield.

DmxSimple handles all communication with the DMX bus for you, sending out data packets at frequent intervals.


= Compatibility =
SimpleDMX is compatible with all 16MHz Arduinos using Mega168 chips. 
|| *Arduino Board* || *DmxSimple support* || *Tinker.it! DMX Shield support* ||
|| Duemilanove || Yes || Yes ||

|| Bluetooth / BT || Yes || Yes ||
|| Pro || 16MHz version || 5V only ||
|| NG || Mega168 only || Yes ||
|| Serial (with 16MHz crystal) || No || Yes ||
|| Nano || Yes || No ||
|| Mini || Yes || No ||
|| Pro Mini || 16MHz only || No ||
|| Bare Bones Board || Yes || No ||

= Installation =

Download [http://tinkerit.googlecode.com/files/DmxSimple.zip the archive]. Extract to (arduino install)/hardware/libraries/DmxSimple . Restart Arduino so it recognises the library.

= Example code =
{{{
#include <DmxInterrupt.h>  // These lines are inserted by
#include <DmxSimple.h>     // Import Library > DmxSimple

void setup() {
  DmxSimple.begin();       // Set up DMX system
}

void loop() {
  int a;
  for (a=0; a<=255; a++) {
    DmxSimple.write(1, a); // Set DMX channel 1 to new value
    delay(10);             // Wait 10ms
  }
}
}}}
This fades DMX channel 1 from 0 to 255.

= Function calls =
  {{{DmxSimple.begin();}}}

  Set up the DMX system. This must be called before DMX will work.

  {{{DmxSimple.write(channel, value);}}}

  Set DMX channel to value.
  Channel has the range 1 to 128 (DMX channels above 128 are not supported).
  Value is in the range 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness).

= Library limitations =
  * Timer 1 is used. This breaks analogWrite on pins 9 and 10. Pins 5, 6 and 11 are still available for PWM output.
  * A significant amount of time is spent with interrupts off. Avoid using the serial port for high speed communication, as the receiver may miss some characters.
  * Pin 3 is permanently in use for DMX transmission.
