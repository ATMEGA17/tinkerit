This library gives you a simple way to drive DMX from Arduino. DMX output is on digital pin 3, which is compatible with the Tinker.it! DMX shield.

!DmxSimple handles all communication with the DMX bus, automatically transmitting data packets at frequent intervals.

= Compatibility =
!DmxSimple is compatible with all known Arduinos using Mega8, Mega168 or Mega328 chips running at a standard speed.
The following Arduinos are recommended, as they support both !DmxSimple and the Tinker.it! DMX shield:
  Arduino Duemilanove 328, Arduino Duemilanove, Arduino Diecimila, Arduino Bluetooth, Arduino Pro (5V version only), Arduino NG, Arduino Serial.

= Installation =

Download [http://tinkerit.googlecode.com/files/!DmxSimple.zip the archive]. Extract to (arduino install)/hardware/libraries/!DmxSimple . Restart Arduino so it recognises the library.

= Example code =
  * [FadeUp]
  * [SerialToDmx]

= Function calls =
  ==!DmxSimple.write(channel, value);==
    Set DMX channel to value.
    Channel has the range 1 to 128 (512 on all 328 Arduino).
    Value is in the range 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness).

  ==!DmxSimple.maxChannel(channel);==
    Set the number of DMX channels in the DMX system.
    The DMX system sends out channels in order, starting at 1. So it takes longer to send channels 1-512 than it does to send only channels 1-10. !DmxSimple defaults to sending all channels, but by reducing this you can increase the lamp update rate for even smoother animation.
    Using !DmxSimple.maxChannel(0) turns off the DMX system, so you can use pin 3 as a regular pin. It will revert to a DMX output next time you call !DmxSimple.write() or !DmxSimple.maxChannel(_nonzero_).

= Library limitations =
  Timer 2 is used.
  A significant amount of time is spent with interrupts off. Avoid using the serial port at speeds above 19200 (16MHz Arduino) or 9600 (8MHz Arduino).
  Due to RAM constraints, only 128 channels are supported on 168 or Mega8 Arduinos. Arduinos with processor sockets can easily be upgraded to a 328 to control all 512 channels.
  Pin 3 is used for DMX transmission.
