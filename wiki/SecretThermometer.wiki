#summary Accessing the secret thermometer on the Arduino 328

= Introduction =

It turns out the Arduino 328 has a built in thermometer. Not the old Mega8 or 168. Not the Arduino Mega. Just 328 based Arduinos.

= Code =

Copy, paste into Arduino and see what it returns. It only works on an Arduino with a 328 chip.

{{{
long readTemp() {
  long result;
  // Read temperature sensor against 1.1V reference
  ADMUX = _BV(REFS1) | _BV(REFS0) | _BV(MUX3);
  delay(2); // Wait for Vref to settle
  ADCSRA |= ADSC; // Convert
  while (bit_is_set(ADCSRA,ADSC));
  result = ADCL;
  result |= ADCH<<8;
  result = (result - 125) * 1075;
  return result;
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println( readTemp(), DEC );
  delay(1000);
}
}}}

Temperature is returned in milli-°C. So 25000 is 25°C.

The sensor isn't very accurate - the data sheet says ±10°C. But once you've worked out the offset and correct for it, accuracy improves.

Note the following:
  * This works on Arduinos with a *328 only*. The other chips don't have the sensor.
  * This sensor is pretty useless unless you calibrate it against a known temperature.
  * The sensor outputs in approximately 1°C steps.

But hey - it's free!
