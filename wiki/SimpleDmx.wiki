#labels Featured,DMX,arduino

This library gives you a simple way to drive DMX from Arduino. DMX output is on digital pin 3, which is compatible with the Tinker.it! DMX shield.

= Installation =

Download [http://tinkerit.googlecode.com/files/DmxSimple.zip the archive]. Extract to (arduino install)/hardware/libraries/SimpleDmx . Restart Arduino so it recognises the library.

= Example code =
Examples are in File > Sketchbook > Libraries > SimpleDmx

= Function calls =
  * SimpleDmx.begin();
  Set up the DMX system. This must be called before DMX will work.
  * SimpleDmx.write(channel, value);
  Set DMX channel to value.
  Channel has the range 1 to 128 (DMX channels above 128 are not supported).
  Value is in the range 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness).
